## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Interactive UI:** Enjoy a snappy and intuitive user experience with smooth transitions and real-time feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** Seamlessly playable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Scalable Structure:** Designed for easy feature expansion (think: AI opponent, online multiplayer, leaderboards).
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Harnesses the power of React, functional components, and hooks.

## ⭐ Project Highlights
